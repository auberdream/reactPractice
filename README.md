# reactPractice

### What is this?

This is a test project to teach myself React. It's a simple tic-tac-toe game that alternates players and declares a winner.

### How to use

* clone this repo
* `npm install`
* `npm start` (you should be directed to the localhost automatically)
* play!

### Resources

I used [this React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

### Next steps
